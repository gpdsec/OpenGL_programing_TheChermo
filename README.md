# the-cherno
My code-along for TheCherno tutorials.
The code here is intended to run on MacOS.
If you want to compile on \*Nix, see the branch named **linux**.
For Windows you will need to modify the Makefiles in each episode directory for your environment.
Any differences between TheCherno's code and mine is likely a result of my compilation environment.
YMMV.

Currently working through [TheCherno's OpenGL tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2 "TheCherno OpenGL Tutorial").

See all of his videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw "TheChernoProject").

Support him on [his Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/thecherno/overview "TheCherno Patreon") if you want to see more!

To run any of the episodes, cd into that episode directory, run make, and then either ./playground or ./app depending on which
episode. The earlier episodes compiled into a binary named **playground**, and later episodes compiled into a binary named **app**.
